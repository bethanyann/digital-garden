        # About Buffer
        
        We create social media and brand-building software for small businesses, creators, and individuals. Our mission is to provide essential tools to help small businesses get off the ground and grow. Through exceptional customer service and uplifting content, we help our customers believe they can succeed and do good along the way.
        
        Buffer is a fully distributed team, and we’ve always aimed to do things a little differently at Buffer. Since the early days, we’ve focused on building one of the most unique and fulfilling workplaces by rethinking a lot of traditional practices. We also default to transparency, so you can read all about our metrics, and our successes and failures along the way on our [Transparency Dashboard](https://buffer.com/open).
        
        We're united by Buffer's [values](https://buffer.com/about#values), and we hire and work from all over the world. We strive to create a diverse and inclusive work environment, and we are building a culture where underrepresented groups are welcome and can flourish. Please note that we do travel to work together in person once or twice per year, and those events are highly encouraged to build deeper connections among our small team.
        
        As you get to know Buffer and consider joining the journey, feel free to read more from [Kirsti](https://buffer.com/resources/first-30-days-buffer/) and [Sabreen](https://buffer.com/resources/joined-3-days-before-the-retreat/) as they share their first experiences with Buffer, as well as from [Hailley](https://buffer.com/resources/8-years-at-buffer/), who captured why she still calls Buffer home after 8+ years.
        
        # Value-Led Growth at Buffer
        
        **We've changed how we approach Growth at Buffer, by making user value a core principle.** Value-Led Growth (VLG) is Buffer’s evolution of Product-Led Growth (PLG). At its core, PLG is about driving growth by delivering value — helping people experience meaningful outcomes before any transaction takes place (i.e. putting value before revenue). The best PLG companies extend this value-first mindset across the entire customer journey.
        
        Value-Led Growth is how we bring this principle to life at Buffer. It’s our way of connecting every team — Product, Marketing, Customer Advocacy, and beyond — around a shared goal: to help creators and small businesses experience real value as early and as often as possible. When we lead with value, growth follows naturally.
        
        # About the role
        
        We're looking for a senior frontend engineer to join this newly formed Value-Led Growth team and help shape how we grow Buffer through genuine customer and user value.
        
        You'll take the lead on building core parts of our growth experience, including Buffer’s affiliate and referral program, pricing plans and packaging that prioritizes value over paywalls, continuing to make Buffer’s Free Plan the best in market, and supporting Buffer’s public tier - opening up access to Buffer’s value beyond signed in users.
        
        We need someone with strong product instincts, growth domain experience, and the ability to work independently across team boundaries. You care about metrics and user behavior as much as polished UI — thoughtful conversion flows, data-driven decisions, and experiences that genuinely serve our users. You'll collaborate closely with our Staff Growth Product Manager, engineers from other teams, and various stakeholders to explore opportunities, validate ideas, and ship high-impact growth initiatives.
        
        We're a small, collaborative team that puts value before revenue in our decision making. We iterate based on real user data, care deeply about long-term customer relationships, and focus on building trust through exceptional experiences. You'll have space to lead, evangelize growth thinking across Buffer, and help establish the foundations of our growth engineering culture.
        
        # What you’ll do
        
        - Lead the development of core growth features — referral and affiliate program, improve pricing and packaging to optimize for Buffer's core value, and building Buffer's public tier and free tools to provide value far beyond signed-in users.
        - Drive growth experimentation — implement A/B tests, track key metrics to continue making Buffer's free plan the best in the market, optimize conversion and engagement that drive stronger acquisition and retention.
        - Collaborate across teams, you'll work closely with other teams to identify growth opportunities and implement solutions that span multiple domains.
        - Shape growth platform capabilities, build tools and systems that enable other teams to easily implement growth features, run experiments, and optimize their own conversion funnels.
        - Shape frontend architecture and UI standards, guide technical decisions from state management and component structure to evolving our internal design system (Popcorn), refining shared patterns, and ensuring our interfaces remain consistent, accessible, and scalable across growth initiatives.
        - Take shared ownership of product quality and system health. You'll participate in our on-call rotation — all engineers take a 24/7 week-long shift roughly once a quarter. You'll also contribute to the ongoing work that keeps our systems running smoothly and continuously improving, like fixing bugs, addressing security vulnerabilities, and other improvements
        - Contribute to shaping our team’s engineering culture by sharing knowledge, reviewing code, and helping us all get better over time.
        
        # Helpful skills and experience
        
        - You have solid experience building interactive, user-facing applications with modern web tech — we use React, TypeScript, and GraphQL, but we care more about your ability to reason well and learn quickly than a specific stack.
        - You understand growth domain challenges — maybe you've built referral systems, optimized conversion flows, or implemented experimentation frameworks — and you enjoy solving problems that directly impact business metrics.
        - You're comfortable with data and analytics — you can set up tracking, analyze experiment results, and make data-driven decisions about feature development and optimization.
        - You have strong product judgment and a good sense of taste. You notice the small things, care about the feel of an interface, and bring a high bar to the UI details that shape user experience.
        - You’re comfortable navigating ambiguity and working independently, can drive technical discussions across teams, and help establish engineering practices for a growing team.
        - You’ve led significant frontend initiatives or projects, bringing clarity and direction to complex problems and guiding work from early exploration through to delivery.
        - You have a personal stake in the world of content creation, maybe you’ve run a newsletter, built an audience on social media, or regularly share your own work online. You’ve used Buffer before and care about the experience of planning, creating, and publishing content.
        - You thrive in remote, async environments. You communicate clearly, support your teammates, and don’t wait for permission to make progress.
        - You’re product-minded and user-oriented — you think beyond the ticket, consider edge cases and user experience, and bring a strong sense of ownership to your work.
        - You’re comfortable working with backend code when needed, and you understand how frontend decisions connect to the bigger picture.
        - You’re fluent with AI tools and use them to work with more leverage and level up your own efficiency.
        - You’ve likely been doing this for 7+ years, but depth matters more to us than a specific number.
        
        # Our tech stack
        
        - We use React and TypeScript for our web frontends
        - We have internal design system called Popcorn that we started developing last year, it is built with Radix primitives, CSS modules, Storybook and our own system of design tokens
        - We are in the process of migrating to GraphQL, we use Apollo Client in our web application
        - We write automated tests with jest, react testing library (for integration tests) and Playwright (for e2e tests)
        - On the backend, we use NodeJS, TypeScript and MongoDB
        - We are running our services on AWS with Kubernetes. We follow a micro-services architecture and are currently moving our services into a central shared monorepo.
        
        # Interview process
        
        Here's what our hiring process for this role is like.
        
        1. **Application.** When submitting your application and resume, tell us why you want to join Buffer and take your time. This is your chance to make a strong first impression.
            - Please note: While we have several engineering roles open, we recommend applying to only one role - just choose one that resonates with you the most. If during our review or interviews we think you'd be great for a different position, we'll re-route your application internally.
        2. **Hiring manager interview.** Chat with the hiring manager for your role to understand what it takes to work at Buffer. This is an opportunity for both sides to get to know each other and determine whether our expectations align.
        3. **Code review assignment.** We'll send you ****30-minute asynchronous assignment to review a pull request, to help us understand how you think about code and communicate technical ideas.
        4. **Technical interviews.** Interview with a couple of engineers from Buffer focused on your technical experience and approach. Additionally, for senior+ roles, we'll have an additional conversation about your leadership, how you work with teams, and how you approach the broader challenges that come with this level.
        5. **Meet the CEO.** At the very end, you will have the opportunity to meet with Joel Gascoigne, our CEO. This is a great chance for you to gain a deeper understanding of Buffer's strategy, values, and work processes.
        6. **Collaboration period.** This is experimental stage for us where you would work with us on a real project over 2 days (fully paid). The goal is to see how it feels to work in the team, both for us and for you. You'll meet a few bufferoos, we'll kickoff the project, and invite you to a Slack and you'll collaborate with the team on it.
        7. **Offer.** We wrap it up with an offer and discuss the final details. We would align on the last bits before we make you part of the Buffer team 💛

        Modern software delivery was supposed to be the foundation for a thriving digital business but reality has proven otherwise.

The LaunchDarkly platform helps developers innovate on new features faster while protecting them with a safety valve to instantly rewind when things go wrong. Developers can target product experiences to any customer segment and maximize the business impact of every feature. And by gradually rolling out new application components, they escape nightmare "big-bang" technology migrations.
        
        The LaunchDarkly platform was built to guide engineers to the next frontier of DevOps by:
        
        - Improving the velocity and stability of software releases, without the fear of end customer outages
        - Delivering targeted experiences by easily personalizing features to customer cohorts
        - Maximizing the business impact of every feature through the ability to experiment and optimize
        - Coordinating the release and optimization of software to provide consistent experiences across mobile platforms and device types
        - Improving the effectiveness and productivity of engineering teams, by providing insights into engineering cadence and stability
        
        At LaunchDarkly, we believe in the power of teams. We're building a team that is humble, open, collaborative, respectful and kind. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
