# Welcome


Welcome to my digital garden. This is a place for me to gather both complete and incomplete thoughts on any topic that catches my interest. Consider everything you find here a work in progress.

There will likely be a lot of software development & tech notes, but my interests are fairly wide ranging. 

I also intend for this to be a public place where I can store links that are easily shared with others, as well as have book notes shared here. Less of a blog, more of a place for me to put resources.

Although this is a different use case for a "digital garden" than what I am doing, this is a really lovely post by joel hooks about what a digital garden _is_ and how to make one

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
