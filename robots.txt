robots.txt setting
Protect your website or application from AI crawlers by implementing a robots.txt file on your domain to direct AI bot operators on what content they can and cannot scrape for AI model training.

AI bots are expected to follow the robots.txt directives.

robots.txt files express your preferences. They do not prevent crawler operators from crawling your content at a technical level. Some crawler operators may disregard your robots.txt preferences and crawl your content regardless of what your robots.txt file says.

Note

Respecting robots.txt is voluntary. If you want to prevent crawling, use AI Crawl Control's manage AI crawlers feature.

Compatibility with existing robots.txt files
Cloudflare will independently check whether your website has an existing robots.txt file and update the behavior of this feature based on your website.

Existing robots.txt file
If your website already has a robots.txt file — verified by a HTTP 200 response — Cloudflare will prepend our managed robots.txt before your existing robots.txt, combining both into a single response.

For example, without this feature enabled, the robots.txt content of crawlstop.com would be:

Feature not enabled
User-agent: *
Disallow: /lp
Disallow: /feedback
Disallow: /langtest

Sitemap: https://www.crawlstop.com/sitemap.xml

With the managed robots.txt enabled, Cloudflare will prepend our managed content before your original content, resulting in what you can view at https://www.crawlstop.com/robots.txt ↗.

Feature enabled
# As a condition of accessing this website, you agree to abide by the
# following content signals:

# (a)  If a content-signal = yes, you may collect content for the
#      corresponding use.
# (b)  If a content-signal = no, you may not collect content for the
#      corresponding use.
# (c)  If the website operator does not include a content signal for a
#      corresponding use, the website operator neither grants nor restricts
#      permission via content signal with respect to the corresponding use.

# The content signals and their meanings are:

# search: building a search index and providing search results (e.g., returning
#         hyperlinks and short excerpts from your website's contents). Search
#         does not include providing AI-generated search summaries.
# ai-input: inputting content into one or more AI models (e.g., retrieval
#           augmented generation, grounding, or other real-time taking of
#           content for generative AI search answers).
# ai-train: training or fine-tuning AI models.

# ANY RESTRICTIONS EXPRESSED VIA CONTENT SIGNALS ARE EXPRESS RESERVATIONS OF
# RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVE 2019/790 ON COPYRIGHT
# AND RELATED RIGHTS IN THE DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET.
